# Cultural Couture

A responsive ecommerce website customized to promote costume and fancy dress rentals online.  
This project is a significantly modified version of an open-source template, adapted by Pankaj Kumar to suit the branding and business needs of a local costume shop in Rampur.

## Project Overview

Cultural Couture addresses a real gap in my city, where very few stores offer online options for renting or purchasing fancy dress and costume items.  
This project was built as a learning initiative and practical solution — giving a local business a digital presence with a customized design and product layout.

## Features

- Responsive layout for all devices  
- Product gallery for costumes and fancy dresses  
- Store-specific branding and styling  
- Contact/inquiry form layout  
- Clean and simplified user interface for real users  

## Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript

## My Contributions

While I did not build this project entirely from scratch, I have:  
- Customized the design, layout, and structure based on a store’s real requirements  
- Replaced original demo content with custom categories, branding, and text  
- Made layout and color adjustments to match the local store’s identity  
- Simplified the navigation and interface for ease of use  
- Learned and applied responsive design principles to improve user experience
